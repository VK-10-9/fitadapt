# Adaptive Workout Planner - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

**Product Name:** FitAdapt - Personal Workout Coach  
**Duration:** 2-hour Hackathon Project  
**Tech Stack:** Frontend (React/HTML), API Routes, Supabase Database  

**Vision:** An intelligent workout planner that automatically adapts exercise routines based on user performance, progress, and activity patterns to maximize fitness outcomes.

## 2. Problem Statement

- Generic workout plans don't account for individual progress and recovery
- Users struggle to modify routines based on their performance
- Lack of data-driven insights to optimize workout effectiveness
- No automatic adjustment for missed sessions or overexertion

## 3. Core Features (MVP)

### 3.1 User Profile & Setup
- **Quick onboarding:** Fitness level, goals, available equipment
- **Activity tracking:** Manual workout completion logging
- **Progress metrics:** Weight, reps, duration tracking

### 3.2 Adaptive Algorithm Engine
- **Performance analysis:** Compare actual vs planned performance
- **Difficulty adjustment:** Auto-increase/decrease based on completion rates
- **Recovery consideration:** Factor in rest days and intensity patterns
- **Goal alignment:** Modify routines to match user objectives

### 3.3 Workout Generation
- **Dynamic routines:** Generate workouts based on current fitness state
- **Exercise library:** Curated database of exercises with variations
- **Progressive overload:** Automatic weight/rep/duration increases
- **Alternative suggestions:** Backup exercises for equipment limitations

### 3.4 Progress Tracking Dashboard
- **Performance metrics:** Visual charts of strength, endurance gains
- **Adaptation insights:** Show how and why routines changed
- **Streak tracking:** Consistency monitoring and motivation
- **Weekly/monthly summaries:** Progress reports and achievements

### 4.3 Supabase Database Schema

#### Tables:

- fitness_level (enum: beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- goals (text array: strength, cardio, weight_loss, muscle_gain)
- equipment (text array)
- created_at (timestamp)

**workouts**
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (uuid, foreign key)
- planned_exercises (jsonb)
- completed_exercises (jsonb)
- difficulty_score (integer)
- completion_rate (decimal)
- date (date)
- duration_minutes (integer)

**exercises**
- id (uuid, primary key)
- name (text)
- category (enum: strength, cardio, flexibility)
- muscle_groups (text array)
- equipment_needed (text array)
- difficulty_base (integer 1-10)
- instructions (text)

**user_progress**
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (uuid, foreign key)
- exercise_id (uuid, foreign key)
- weight_used (decimal)
- reps_completed (integer)

## 5. Adaptation Algorithm Logic

### 5.1 Performance Scoring
```javascript
const calculatePerformanceScore = (workout) => {
  const completionRate = workout.completed_exercises.length / workout.planned_exercises.length;
  const difficultyFactor = workout.difficulty_score / 10;
  const consistencyBonus = getConsistencyScore(user, last7Days);
  
  return (completionRate * 0.6) + (difficultyFactor * 0.3) + (consistencyBonus * 0.1);
};
```

### 5.2 Adaptation Triggers
- **Increase Difficulty:** 3+ consecutive workouts with 90%+ completion
- **Decrease Difficulty:** 2+ consecutive workouts with <70% completion
- **Change Exercise:** Same exercise fails 3 times in a row
- **Add Rest Day:** Completion rate drops below 60% over a week

### 5.3 Progression Rules
- **Strength:** +5-10% weight or +1-2 reps when performance score > 8/10
- **Cardio:** +2-5 minutes duration or +10% intensity
- **New Exercises:** Introduce when user plateaus on current routine
